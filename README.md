# Phaser 3 + Webpack 4 + ES6 Boilerplate

# Built for ready to go.

You know that feeling when on a Sunday eve you got that great feeling of coding something (For me its most of the times mini-games).
Yeah, we all get it from time to time...

So you decide to sit down in a couzy place. Crank that laptop open. Open your IDE and ready to roll out the next great peace of software.

...NOT

Why? Because before you can code something you need to do the setup.
That each time gets more and more complicated and you can never remember some small detail from the previos setup that you need to advance.
So you sit there after 2 coffees and few hours passed... and you realize that the urge has long gone and you rather be doing something else.

And there goes another unfinished project...

Well no more! Follow the few steps below and all the basic stuff from the setup point will be done.

Just run the setup and type the code of your next masterpiece. 

# Setup
